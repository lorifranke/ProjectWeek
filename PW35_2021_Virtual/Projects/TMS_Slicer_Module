# Project Description

Develop a deep-learning powered software for real-time E-Field prediction and visualization in 3D Slicer

## Objective

Visualization of the TMS E-field on brain surface as well as an E-field along fiber bundles (DTI)

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

Integrate the visualization as a new module within the MRML scene architecture.
